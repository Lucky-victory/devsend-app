## ✨ What is DevSend?

DevSend is a modern email campaign and automation platform designed for **technical product teams** — bridging the gap between developers who need control and marketers who need visibility.

Built on the modern stack (Next.js + Convex + Resend), DevSend lets you:

- ✏️ Build custom emails using **React components** or a visual drag-and-drop editor (powered by Unlayer).
- 📊 Monitor campaign performance — opens, clicks, bounces — in **real-time**.
- 🧩 Manage contacts, lists, templates, and rules from a clean dashboard.
- ⚙️ Trigger emails via API, schedule campaigns, or send based on logic.
- 🔁 Integrate easily into your stack with webhooks, REST triggers, and native React tooling.
