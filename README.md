# 📬 DevSend – Email Campaigns Built for Developers

**DevSend** is a lightweight, developer-first email campaign platform that bridges the gap between "roll-your-own" email systems and clunky, bloated marketing suites like Mailchimp or SendGrid UI.

Built on a modern stack with a focus on developer experience, DevSend enables technical teams to create, manage, and analyze email campaigns using code, modern editors, and real-time analytics — all from a sleek, responsive dashboard.

---

## 🧩 What is DevSend?

DevSend is a hybrid **email template and campaign management system** designed to be **simple for developers**, yet powerful enough to run entire email workflows for startups and technical teams.

- Compose emails using `.tsx` components (via [React Email](https://react.email))
- Or drag-and-drop with a visual editor (Unlayer)
- Send campaigns or transactional emails using [Resend](https://resend.com)
- Manage contacts, schedule campaigns, track performance
- Live analytics, beautiful dashboards, and clean design

---

## 🧠 Why DevSend?

### 💥 Problem

Modern developers often find email tooling to be either:
- Too heavy (e.g., enterprise suites with hard-to-use GUIs), or
- Too raw (e.g., hand-rolling your own email renderer and cron job pipelines)

This leads to:
- Time wasted designing email UIs
- Fragmented campaign tooling
- Frustrating experiences with outdated software

---

### ✅ Solution

DevSend provides a **sweet spot**:
- Code-first control where it matters (template logic, variables, JSX)
- UI where it helps (drag-and-drop layout, contact import, metrics dashboard)
- Modern design, dark/light mode, and real-time feedback

---

## 🎯 Who It's For

- Solo founders & indie hackers
- Early-stage B2B startups
- Technical marketing teams
- Developers building internal or client tools
- Anyone using React/Next.js + Resend

## 🌍 Vision

We believe developer-first email tooling should be:

- Code-friendly by design

DevSend aims to become the default email platform for modern builders — without needing to touch another bloated UI again.
